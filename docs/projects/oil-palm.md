# Oil Palm Plantation (Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand) 1984-2017

This paper used a landsat time series approach coupled with other datasets to determine the year in which the oil palm plantations are first detected, at which point they are 2 to 3 years of age. From this, the approximate age of the oil palm plantation in 2017 was generated.

#### Data Records
The data set is publicly accessible for download from the permanent DARE repository housed by the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) (http://dare.iiasa.ac.at/85/)33. It consists of a 16-bit GeoTIFF at a resolution of 30â€‰m with a single attribute value, i.e., the year in which the oil palm plantation was first detected. At this point, the plantation is 2 to 3 years of age. The data values range from 0 to 37 where 0 is the No Data value. Values 1 to 3 are not present and a value of 4 corresponds to the year 1984, the first year oil palm was detected, and each consecutive number represents the next year, i.e., 5 is 1985, while the maximum value of 37 corresponds to 2017.

#### Earth Engine Snippet

Since the dataset was categorical the no data value was use for masking and a Mode pyramiding policy was applied for ingestion into Google Earth Engine.

```js
var oil_palm = ee.ImageCollection("projects/sat-io/open-datasets/landcover/oil-palm-plantation-1984_2017");
