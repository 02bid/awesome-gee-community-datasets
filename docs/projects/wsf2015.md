# World Settlement Footprint (2015)

The World Settlement Footprint (WSF) 2015 is a 10m (0.32 arc sec) resolution binary mask outlining the 2015 global settlement extent derived by jointly exploiting multitemporal Sentinel-1 radar and Landsat-8 optical satellite imagery.

You can download the [entire archive here]() consisting of 306 GeoTIFF files (EPSG4326 projection, deflate compression) each one referring to a portion of 10x10 degree size (~1110x1110km) whose upper-left and lower-right corner coordinates are specified in the file name [e.g., the tile WSF2015_v1_EPSG4326_e010_n60_e020_n50.tif covers the area between (10E;60N) and (20E;50N)].

Settlements are associated with value 255; all other pixels are associated with value 0.

**The world settlement footprint is now available in the official GEE catalog and [you can find it here](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/DLR_WSF_WSF2015_v1)**
