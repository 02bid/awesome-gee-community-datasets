# MODIS Gap filled Long-term Land Surface Temperature Daily (2003-2020)

High spatiotemporal land surface temperature (LST) datasets are increasingly needed in a variety of fields such as ecology, hydrology, meteorology, epidemiology, and energy systems. In this study the authors  developed a 3-step hybrid method by integrating daily merging (gapfilling missing values at one overpass using values at the other three overpasses each day), spatiotemporal gapfilling (estimating missing values based on values of their spatial and temporal neighbors), and temporal interpolation (gapfilling missing values based on values of their neighboring days), to create a seamless high spatiotemporal LST dataset using the four daily LST observations from the two MODIS instruments on Terra and Aqua satellites.

The method was extended to create a global gap filled LST observation as well. The cross-validation indicates that the average root mean squared error (RMSE) for mid-daytime (1:30pm) and mid-nighttime (1:30am) LST is 1.88K and 1.33K, respectively. The gap-filled LST in the unit of 0.1 Celsius temperature (0.1 degree C) .You can read the [abstract here](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020AGUFMGC127..01Z/abstract)
