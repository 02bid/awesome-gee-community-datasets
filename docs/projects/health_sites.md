# Global Healthsites Mapping Project

Healthsites.io and the Global Healthsites Mapping Project's mission is to help supply governments, NGOs, and the private sector with accurate and up-to-date health facility information. Health facility registers are the building blocks of a well-functioning health information system within a country. Accurate and up-to-date data provides the basic data that helps drive activities like service availability planning, monitoring and evaluation, and disaster risk preparedness.
